## Git, GitHub, Variables and Modeling (60 mins) 
- This final portion of the assessment should not take you longer than 60 minutes
- If you are not finished after 60 minutes, keep working and we will look at your commit history to see how long it took to complete
- If you have technical issues come up, please note in the Submission form at the end of these instructions

## Part I: Creating Directories and Files; Initializing Git and Pushing to GitHub
1. Use your terminal to create a directory called `mod_0_assessment`
1. Inside of that directory, create a file called `variables.rb`
1. Initialize `mod_0_assessment` as a git repository.
1. Add your file and commit using the message `"Initial commit"`
1. Create a public repo on Github with the same name (`mod_0_assessment`).
1. Add the remote and push your local repository to Github.

## Part II: Program Specific Challenge
1. Open up your `variables.rb` file in your text editor.
1. Assign a variable called `famous_person` to a string value of your choosing
1. Assign a variable called `is_active` to a boolean value
1. Re-assign your `famous_person` variable to a new string
1. Assign a variable called `num_3` to a numerical value
1. Assign a variable called `num_9` to a different numerical value
1. Add your `num_9` variable to your `num_3` variable and store the result in a new variable called `sum`
1. Assign a variable called `animals` to an array of three strings
1. Write a line of code that removes the first element from the `animals` array - **You may use Google for this task**
1. Write a line of code that prints how many characters there are in the `famous_person` string - **You may use Google for this task**
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes with the message "Complete program specific challenge"
1. Push your changes to Github.


## Part III: Modeling Using Hashes
1. Inside of `mod_0_assessment`, create a new directory called `models`.
1. Inside of `models`, create two files:
    - `model_a.rb`
    - `model_b.rb`

1. Open up `model_a.rb` in your text editor.
1. Using a **hash**, we want you to model a `SCHOOL` - be sure your model includes the following:
    - Created new variable that follows strong naming conventions and is assigned to a hash
    - 2 keys assigned to a string value
    - 2 keys assigned to an integer or float value
    - 2 keys assigned to a boolean value
    - 2 keys assigned to an array value
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes with a properly formatted commit message
1. Open up `model_b.rb` in your text editor.
1. Using a **hash**,  we want you to model a `PET` - be sure your model includes the following:
    - Created new variable that follows strong naming conventions and is assigned to a hash
    - 2 keys assigned to a string value
    - 2 keys assigned to an integer or float value
    - 2 keys assigned to a boolean value
    - 2 keys assigned to an array value
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes with a properly formatted commit message
1. Push your changes to GitHub.
