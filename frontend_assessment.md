## Part I: Creating Directories and Files; Initializing Git and Pushing to GitHub (10 min)

1. Use your terminal to create a directory called `mod_0_skills`
1. Inside of that directory, make an empty text file called `variables.txt`
1. Initialize `mod_0_skills` as a git repository.
1. Add your file and commit using the message `"Initial commit"`
1. Create a public repo on Github with the same name (`mod_0_skills`).
1. Add the remote and push your local repository to Github.

## Part II: Program Specific Challenge (20 min)
1. Open up your `variables.txt` file in your text editor.
1. Assign a variable called `famousPerson` to a string value of your choosing
1. Assign a variable called `isActive` to a boolean value
1. Re-assign your `famousPerson` variable to a new string
1. Assign a variable called `num3` to a numerical value
1. Assign a variable called `num9` to a different numerical value
1. Add your `num9` variable to your `num3` variable and store the result in a new variable called `sum`
1. Assign a variable called `animals` to an array of three strings
1. Write a line of code that removes the first element from the `animals` array - **You may use Google for this task**
1. Write a line of code that prints how many characters there are in the `famousPerson` string - **You may use Google for this task**
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes with the message "Complete program specific challenge"
1. Push your changes to Github.

## Part III: Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods (40 min)
1. Inside of `mod_0_skills`, create a new directory called `classes`.
1. Inside of `classes`, create four files:
    - `class_1.txt` 
    - `class_1_example_instance.txt`
    - `class_2.txt` 
    - `class_2_example_instance.txt. `
    - *If you're comfortable trying markdown at this point, feel free to use .md instead of .txt*

1. Open up `class_1.txt` in your text editor.
1. Brainstorm one class that might exist in a **SCHOOL** and put this at the top of the file.
List at least four attributes for that class. In parentheses, list the data type for that attribute.
1. List at least four methods for that class. In parentheses, explain what the method does, including the names of the attributes that it uses or modifies.
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes for this class with the message "Update class 1 with attributes and methods"
1. Open up `class_1_example_instance.txt` in your text editor.
1. At the top, type the name of an object that is an instance of your class.
1. List the values for each attribute.
1. List the results of the method being called for this specific object.
1. Save your file.
1. Add and commit your changes for this class.
1. Repeat steps 3-8 with `class_2.txt`.
1. Repeat steps 9-14 with `class_2_example_instance.txt`.
1. Push your changes to GitHub.
